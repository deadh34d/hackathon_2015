>"My husband and I recently purchased a beautiful IDK Home in Grovetown, GA. Being our first new home we were very nervous >getting started. Working with IDK Homes was an easy and excellent experience from start to finish. It means a lot that Ron >and his entire staff made us feel like friends instead of customers. We really felt comfortable knowing that our house was >being built by experts who meticulously made sure that our questions were answered throughout the process. IDK Home’s >attention to detail and outstanding value put our mind at ease. We would highly recommend IDK Homes!  -Alan and Katy

>"Our IDK Home is exactly what we were looking for. We found a great new house in Evans, GA that was perfect for us to down >size into as we near retirement. IDK gave us a great number of options to choose from that really let customize our home to >the way we wanted. I would highly recommend that if you are building in the Augusta area that you talk to IDK Homes." Jeff

>All of my experiences with the IDK team have been very positive and I think they do an excellent job. They addressed my >needs and concerns in a timely, and professional manner. Everyone who comes see my new home is very impressed and I always >tell them to talk to IDK if they are considering building a house on their own property. -Brenda

>The Project Manager was very professional and helped me throughout the process. The sales agent in model was very helpful >and did an outstanding job helping me though the building process. She knows IDK  products well and focused on helping me as >a client instead of just a another sale. -Katy

>The builder warranty process was easy to go through. IDK Homes was very quick to respond to my issues and made everything >right. The warranty technician was the absolute best we have ever worked with and we’ve bought 7 newly constructed homes! >–Cindy and David
