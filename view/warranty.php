                        At IDK Homes, we realize the important decision you are making to build a new home. Your
                        home is a part of the IDK Homes family and we want to protect you and your peace of mind.
                        Each IDK Home we build is offered a two-year non-transferable warranty - that is double the
                        term standard offered in the new home building industry. IDK Homes also offers an optional
                        transferable, "StrucSure" ten-year limited structural warranty. At IDK Homes we stand by the
                        homes we build and we stand by you, the families we build for.
                        To submit a warranty case within the two year period please contact us through this form
                        below. A warranty representative will be in contact with you shortly.
