                Ron Janelle was born and raised in Grovetown, Georgia where he lives with his wife,

                Tina and their 2 sons, Dillon and Dawson.  He has been in the construction field for 28

                years.  During high school Ron worked doing plumbing and went on to obtain his

                license as a Master Plumber in 1995.  He operated his own plumbing company for 10

                years before deciding to venture out into the building business.  In 2005, he obtained his

                Residential License and founded IDK Homes, Inc. where he serves as President/CEO.

                Ron is a member of the Builders Association of Metro Augusta and the Georgia

                Plumbing Trade Association.  He attends continuing education on a regular basis to

                stay up-to-date with the many changes in the home building industry. His years of

                experience in both fields gives him a wealth of knowledge when it comes to building

                residential homes.

                In his free time, Ron loves to hunt, fish, and travel with family.
